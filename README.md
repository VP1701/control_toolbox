This is my hobby repository for doing control theory related C++ scripts and/or programs.



## done
- Discrete PID-controller class that includes different version depending on the chosen discretization method.
    includes antiwindup if chosen

## Currently working on
- extending matrix class
- start working on vector class

## future plans
-State feedback controller
-State predictor
-Kalman predictor
-Kalman filter
